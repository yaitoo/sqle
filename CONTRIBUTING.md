# Contributing
SQLE is actively looking for contributors so feel free to help out when:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

### We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes: `make unit-tests`.
5. Make sure your code lints: `make lint`.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Report bugs using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/yaitoo/sqle/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
  - Write unit tests if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
